%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%
%%  Calculates the transformation from 2D image coordinates to 3D space RCS
%%  Using synthetic data
%%
%%  Inputs:  1. view_info -> struct contains the DICOM info for each slice
%%                           in one view
%%           2. view_size -> [m n s] is the size of the volume
%%           3. range1    -> [c1 c2] min and max value of columns
%%           4. range2    -> [r1 r2] min and max value of rows
%%           5. ortho     -> 0/1 -- not orthogonal/orthogonal
%%           6. view      -> scalar 1-axial 2-sagittal 3-coronal
%%
%%  Outputs: 1. M     -> cell that contains 's' 4x3 matrix from 2D (i,j) to 3D (x,y,z)
%%           2. M1    -> cell that contains 's' 3x4 matrix inverse of M
%%           3. X     -> 4xM matrix contains the x coordinates of the four 
%%                      points that defines the image plane in 3D
%%           4. Y     -> idem, y coordinates
%%           5. Z     -> idem, y coordinates
%%           6. plane -> sx4 matrix which each row contains
%%                      (A,B,C,D) of the plane Ax + By + Cz + D =0
%%
%% NOTE: in case we crop the volume, range1 & range2 will be different than
%%       [0 cols-1] & [0 rows-1]
